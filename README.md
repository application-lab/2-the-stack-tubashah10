# Assignment 2: The Stack
Due Wednesday, September 18

# Instructions
1. Click on the github classroom link in the `lab-2` channel
2. Open the `2-THE-STACK-yourgithubusername` folder in vscode.
3. You'll be editing the the `index.html` file and creating and linking a `styles.css` file. 
4. Once you've made your website and tested that it works, `git push` your changed file - this is your assignment submission (don't forget a `commit` message)!

##Prompt##
Choose one of the negative impacts of a digital life you listed in the prior assignment and investigate the stack that you believe is underlying this phenomenon — be as detailed as possible and investigate the 6 layers that Professor Bratton, author of The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty mentioned in his talk — Earth, Cloud, City, Address, Interface, User. 

For example, you might have identified playing Fortnite on your phone at the table instead of being present with loved ones as having a negative impact on your relationship with your family. You might decide to start with the User layer (yourself), the Interface layer, in this case, the Fortnite app for iOS (or even the virtual world they’re playing in) and work your way through the Address layer (your home wifi) to the City layer, your Internet Service Provider (China Telecom) to the Cloud layer (Fortnite servers) and to the Earth layer (to someone playing thousands of miles away).

##Create some media!##
Create 6 images, where each image is one layer of the stack. You can be as creative as you’d like, but your audience should have a sense of the negative impact that you’re trying to convey. 

##Make a website##
Take your 6 images, and create a simple website that showcases them. Include some text describing each, and be sure and add some `.css` styles.

##Image hosting##
https://imggmi.com/ is a good site to host your images (remember that if you link to a file on your computer, others won't be able to see it)
